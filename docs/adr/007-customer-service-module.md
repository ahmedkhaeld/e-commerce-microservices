# ADR 007: Customer Service Module

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-21  
**Authors:** E-commerce Development Team  
**Reviewers:** Architecture Review Board

## Context

The E-Commerce platform requires a dedicated customer management system to handle user profiles, registration, and customer-related operations. As part of our microservices architecture, we need to design a service that can operate independently while integrating seamlessly with other platform components.

### Business Requirements
- Customer registration and profile management
- Customer data persistence with GDPR compliance
- Integration with authentication services
- Support for multiple client applications (web, mobile, admin)
- High availability and scalability for customer operations

### Technical Context
- Existing microservices architecture with Spring Boot
- Service discovery via Eureka Discovery Server
- Centralized configuration management via Config Server
- MongoDB as the document database for customer data
- REST API standards for inter-service communication

## Decision

We will implement the Customer Service as an independent microservice with the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Service Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Data MongoDB
- **Database:** MongoDB for flexible customer data schema
- **API Design:** RESTful APIs following OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- **Validation:** Bean Validation (JSR-303) for request validation

### 2. Data Model Design
```java
// Core customer entity with embedded address
Customer {
    id: String (MongoDB ObjectId)
    firstname: String
    lastname: String  
    email: String (unique, indexed)
    address: Address (embedded document)
    createdAt: LocalDateTime
    updatedAt: LocalDateTime
}
```

### 3. API Design Patterns
- **CRUD Operations:** Standard REST endpoints for customer lifecycle
- **Existence Checks:** Dedicated endpoint for other services to verify customer existence
- **Validation:** Request/response DTOs with comprehensive validation
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### 4. Integration Patterns
- **Service Discovery:** Register with Eureka for service-to-service communication
- **Configuration Management:** External configuration via Config Server
- **Authentication:** Stateless service relying on JWT tokens from Auth Service
- **Inter-service Communication:** Synchronous REST calls with circuit breaker patterns

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **CustomerController:** REST API layer with comprehensive CRUD operations
2. **CustomerService:** Business logic layer with data transformation
3. **CustomerRepository:** Data access layer using Spring Data MongoDB
4. **CustomerMapper:** DTO-Entity mapping using MapStruct
5. **Exception Handling:** Custom exceptions with global exception handler

### API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/customers           - Create customer
PUT    /api/v1/customers           - Update customer
GET    /api/v1/customers           - List all customers
GET    /api/v1/customers/{id}      - Get customer by ID
GET    /api/v1/customers/exists/{id} - Check customer existence
DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}      - Delete customer
```

### Data Consistency Strategy
- **Transactional Operations:** Use MongoDB transactions for multi-document operations
- **Eventual Consistency:** Accept eventual consistency for cross-service operations
- **Idempotency:** Ensure PUT and DELETE operations are idempotent
- **Soft Deletes:** Implement soft deletion for audit trails and GDPR compliance

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
✅ **Independent Scalability:** Customer service can scale based on user registration patterns  
✅ **Technology Flexibility:** MongoDB allows flexible customer data schema evolution  
✅ **Service Isolation:** Failures in customer service don't affect other business functions  
✅ **Development Velocity:** Teams can develop and deploy customer features independently  
✅ **Data Ownership:** Clear data boundaries following Domain-Driven Design principles

### Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Data Consistency
**Challenge:** Ensuring customer data consistency across services  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement eventual consistency patterns
- Use customer existence checks before critical operations
- Consider implementing distributed transactions for critical workflows

#### 2. Authentication and Authorization
**Challenge:** Managing customer authentication across microservices  
**Mitigation:**
- Delegate authentication to dedicated Auth Service (OAuth2/JWT)
- Implement stateless authentication with token validation
- Use API Gateway for centralized security policies

#### 3. API Versioning and Evolution
**Challenge:** Maintaining backward compatibility as customer data model evolves  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement API versioning strategy (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI

#### 4. Service Dependencies
**Challenge:** Managing dependencies on Discovery Server and Config Server  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external service calls
- Use local fallback configurations
- Design for graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable

#### 5. Data Privacy and Compliance
**Challenge:** GDPR compliance and data privacy regulations  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Add audit logging for customer data access
- Implement "right to be forgotten" functionality
- Regular compliance audits and documentation

### Operational Considerations
- **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive metrics and health checks
- **Logging:** Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- **Backup and Recovery:** MongoDB backup strategies and disaster recovery plans



## Review and Update Schedule
This ADR will be reviewed quarterly or when significant changes to customer requirements or technical constraints occur.
