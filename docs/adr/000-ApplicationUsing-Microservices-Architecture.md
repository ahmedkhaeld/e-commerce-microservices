### Explanation of Implementing an E-commerce Application Using Microservices Architecture


- **Starting from Business Requirements:**  
  Begin by understanding the client's needs and translating those into clear, actionable business requirements for the e-commerce system.

- **Application Design with Microservices:**  
  Design the system as a collection of small, independent services (microservices), each responsible for a specific business domain or function (e.g., customer management, product catalog, orders, payments).

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach:**  
  Use DDD to identify and model the core domains and subdomains of the application, ensuring each microservice encapsulates a distinct domain with its own data and logic.

- **Configuration Service:**  
  Implement a centralized configuration service to externalize and manage configuration settings for all microservices, enabling easier updates and consistency.

- **Discovery Server:**  
  Use a discovery server where microservices register themselves on startup, allowing dynamic discovery of service instances for communication and load balancing.

- **API Gateway:**  
  Set up an API Gateway as a single entry point that routes incoming client requests to the appropriate microservices, handling concerns like authentication, routing, and rate limiting.

- **Asynchronous Communication:**  
  Establish asynchronous messaging (e.g., using Kafka) between microservices to decouple services, improve scalability, and handle events like order confirmation and payment processing without blocking the system.

### Business Requirements Overview

- **Client Need:**  
  Develop an **E-commerce application** to solve manual operation challenges faced by the business owner.

- **Current Situation:**  
  The client manages a **diverse product line** manually, with each product identified by a unique code and detailed description.

- **Customer Interaction:**  
  Customers place orders using personal details (name, email, address). Each transaction is followed by an **email confirmation** after successful payment.

- **Goal:**  
  Build a dedicated application to **streamline operations**, improve efficiency, and support business growth.

### Application Design Summary

- **Key Entities:**

    - **Customer:** Unique ID, first name, last name, email, and address.
    - **Product:** Name, description, category, available quantity, and price (confirmed with client).
    - **Category:** Organizes products by name and description.
    - **Order:** Identified by an ID, with multiple order lines linking products and quantities.
- **Order Management:**

    - **Order Line:** Resolves many-to-many relationship between orders and products, includes quantity.
    - **Payment:** Each order has a payment entity with ID, reference, amount, and status (success/failure).
    - **Notification:** Tracks and sends updates to customers after payment.
    - **Design Focus:** Resilience (fault tolerance) and scalability (handle increased traffic).
- **Payment Processing & Development Needs:**

    - Rapid development and deployment to stay competitive.
    - Enhanced monitoring and debugging for scalability and performance.
    - Architecture choice aligns with these client requirements.
