# ADR 0004: Config Server Module

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a centralized configuration management system to handle configuration properties across different environments and services. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and enabling dynamic configuration updates without requiring application restarts.

## Decision

We will implement a Config Server module that will:
1. Serve as a centralized configuration repository
2. Provide configuration properties to all microservices
3. Support different environments (dev, staging, prod)
4. Enable dynamic configuration updates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Centralized configuration management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Dynamic configuration updates without service restarts
- Reduced configuration duplication

### Negative
- Additional infrastructure component to maintain
- Additional network calls for configuration retrieval

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- Spring Boot Application with `@EnableConfigServer` annotation
- Native profile for local configuration storage
- Server port: 8888
- Configuration storage: `classpath:/configurations`
